The scripts have names that hopefully indicate what they are doing.

The important scripts to Look at (with order):
1) First processing of CpG 
2) bin_the_genomes & bin_the_genomes_keeping strand (pretty much the same)
2) bin_distributions
3)rank_the_binned_genomes 
4)Annotate_the_top_bins (&chromhmm)
5)annotate_genomic_elements (& adding expression info if you care)
